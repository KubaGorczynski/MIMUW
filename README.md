# MIMUW
Listings done during "Matematyka dla ciekawych świata" project at University of Warsaw. 

We've covered some basics about number theory and cryptography:
* Fermat's little theorem
* Chinese remainder theorem
* Ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère and more)

...but also typical IT stuff:
* RSA public key encryption algorithm
* PLT (programming language theory)
* Automata theory

If you want to know more about that project, please visit [this site](http://ciekawi.icm.edu.pl/drupal/). 

Here's the poster from 8th edition:
